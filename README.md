## Welcome to Team Two's Embedded Systems Github!
All of our code for our project is in this repository. The webserver.js file will run on the Raspberry Pi that is connected to the pool sensors and the hardware peripherals. When it is run properly with node it will create a server that listens at the Pi's IP address and port 8000. If you connect to this IP it will serve the Index.html file and allow you to access the the controls for the pool. 


### For the developers
Some good resources for us to use are as follows:
